        " We have chosen to display the distribution of the white blood cell count (WBC) of patients by using a histogram with an X-axis displaying WBC (thousands) per microliter of blood and Y-axis representing the number of patients who recorded a specific range of WBC. We believed this was a good choice as it clearly links the WBC to a quantity of patients, and by looking at the height of the WBC bars and matching them with the corresponding Y-axis value, doctors can determine the most common ranges and identify any unusual values in the population in the future, with the most common WBC range being between 0-25 with approximately 85% of all patients falling into this range as seen in figure 1.",
